        This app is for you who might need to find gas stations (both natural gas and
        regular gas and diesel) in Sweden.
        \nYou can download KML-files and install them for the app by clicking Download.
        Note that the KML-files must contain a Placemark-tag with name-tag and Point-tag.
        \nThe best way to ensure valid KML-files is to use the site from Download.
        \nYou can also get a navigation to the closest stations by either distance or traveling time.
